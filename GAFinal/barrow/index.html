    <p>I hemmed and hawwed about the route – the North Downs, the Icknield and other ways – all the national routes with sections a train ride from London. I settled on the South Downs, but I nearly plumped for the Icknield way. Robert McFarlane writes beautifully about it in <em>The Old Ways</em>; his connections to the paths and places on it roll naturally from the page.</p> 

    <blockquote>"Technology that used to be weaponry is essential for getting me to the sea"</blockquote>

    <p>What I like about McFarlane is that his writing lacks the disgust for technology common to his peers. Technology that used to be weaponry (GPS, aerial photography, maps, the internet) is essential for walking. It's essential for someone like me, getting from Brixton to the sea.</p>

    <p>My bag is obviously much too heavy. I have a bundle of snacks, three litres of liquid, and a few assorted ‘nice to haves’ – spare phone battery, blister plasters, kindle, wireless keyboard etc. It feels excessive. It is excessive.</p> 

    <blockquote>"From the train I cannot see the hilltops; they’re shrouded in an ugly grey fog"</blockquote>

    <p>The weather’s looking foul and heavy. From the train I cannot see the hilltops between Lewes and Eastbourne; they’re shrouded in an ugly grey fog. ‘I can walk in this...’ I think, ‘but it’s not going to make for good Instagram.’</p>

    <p>When I get to Eastbourne I’m instantly lost. My plan had been to head to the pier to look at the sea – to throw a stone in the water for luck and whatnot – but I accidentally start walking inland, along the bridleway route. This is the wrong path.</p>

    <blockquote>"I’m on course for about thirty seconds before I steer wrong again"</blockquote>

    <p>Half an hour later I’m at the start of the trail. I'm on course for about thirty seconds before I steer wrong again and have to stamp over heath to get right.</p> 

    <p>The thing I’m surprised by are the birds. In the grey they’re screaming <em>hellos</em> at each other. Pairs of magpies – I love magpies – bounce and glide on the downland updraft, chasing bugs. I’m tailed by a jay for half a mile. She’s beautiful.</p>

    <p>Grey cloud has given way to white, and as I start walking uphill I see in the distance the lighthouse at Beachy Head. It’s candy striped and strange, especially here.</p> 

    <p>Beachy Head. I know that name, everyone knows that name: it’s where people go to die.</p> 

    <blockquote>"Beachy Head: it’s where people go to die"</blockquote>
    
    <p>I skirt the cliff fence for a while, aware of something pressing against my hip-bone. It’s the stone for the sea. The stone is rose quartz, something I’d bought a month or so previous. A little thing to remind me to take a few minutes each day to slow down and be <em>okay</em> with myself.</p>

    <p>But something else happened. Over weeks sat in my pocket and  my bag the thing had taken on weight. It had a presence. It would tumble out and cajole, digging into me. It dragged and poked and reminded when reminders weren’t wanted.</p> 

    <p>I am here, in part, to throw it into the sea.</p>

    <p>I take the stone out. I'm standing at Beachy Head, and the sun has started slipping from between the clouds. It’s pink and luminous, and I kiss it. That feels deeply weird, emabarrassing even, but everyone else on the cliffside is thinking their own thing, staring into their own middle distance and - fuckit - it’s not as if I can <em>un</em>kiss it.</p> 
    
    <blockquote>"I listen for a moment, but the waves just do their thing"</blockquote>

    <p>I draw my arm down to throw it up and out to sea. I hesitate for a second, this half thrown thing nearly stopping me dead, but it tumbles out of my hand anyway. Its arc carries it higher than my head before it drops suddenly, out of sight.</p> 

    <p>I listen for <em>something</em> for a moment, but the waves just do their thing. I no longer feel its weight. I move on.</p>

    <p>I turn from Beachy Head, and the sun starts blazing. The grey clouds clear in minutes. I'm in a warm and golden glow from here on in.</p>

    <p>Along the ridges clouds tumble over and out to sea. It means that a good half dozen times I see something like a smoke machine along the path ahead. It’s coming on towards midday and the sight is as eerie as anything.</p>

    <p>Through Alfriston. It's cute, but not a place I have time to linger. The road east quickly becomes a gravel track and I spend a mile or so skirting hedgerows, putting some contours between me and the sea.</p> 

    <p>My head tickles from the cold-brew coffee I've necked, but I begin to notice less and less. Birds and bugs are the first to go, only magpies catch my eye. Next the grazing animals go. Then, eventually, the landscape.</p> 

    <blockquote>"I spend a mile or so skirting hedgerows, putting some contours between me and the sea"</blockquote>

    <p>I start to notice the different parts of me instead. Things start hurting. I’m aware of my feet. They feel full of blood now, loaded with the excess of a day’s travel. Sunburn too, across the back of my neck and right where the hem rubs.</p>

    <p>No sweat now. My collar is chafing against maybe burned skin. My hair keeps flicking into my eyes, leaving behind traces of drying sunscreen. The combination burns.</p> 

    <p>Walking this long, things hurt. My right thigh. Then the groin that side. Then my left buttock. Fuck. The muscle there just hurts. It just <em>ow</em>. I’m so out of shape and not at all old enough to be.</p> 

    <blockquote>"My sense of place on the map is well out of whack"</blockquote>   

    <p>I don’t know words. For a bit.</p> 

    <p>I think that from where I am I can make the 17:09. This is not true. My sense of place on the map is well out of whack. I'll be lucky if I make one an hour later. It's all just hills and chalk and flint. Chalk and flint.</p> 

    <p>The surface is uneven. My legs twitch like a gyroscope to keep me upright. Every damn step. I slump on a barrow by a beacon.</p> 

    <p>I have covered an uppy downy fifteen and a bit miles by this point. I am tired. That's not far, but it’s quite hot and I am not at all used to this. And then I’m walking, again, because I want to get home.</p>

    <p>More animals. Sheep, cattle, dozens of blackbirds, a flock of two hundred seagulls. A magpie; one for sorrow.</p>

    <blockquote>"Everything hurts exactly enough that I don’t know what I’m stepping on"</blockquote> 

    <p>I am moving at exactly the wrong speed. If I continue at this pace I’ll make it to Southease about ten minutes after the hourly train home. I am not taking that kind of shit for anything.</p> 

    <p>My pace picks up. And then I start jogging. And then I realise that won’t be fast enough, so I start jogging off the proper path and down a hill. This is a fucking stupid decision because everything hurts exactly enough that I don’t know what I’m stepping on; I’m a rabbit hole away from injury.</p>

    <p>I make it to the station glowing with heat, radiating tiredness. I’ve only been at this seven and a bit hours. The train is late.</p>
